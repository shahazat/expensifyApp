untracked Files | Unstaged Changes | Staged Changes | Commits 

untracked Files are just files . 
git add : moves a file from 'untracked Files' to 'Staged Changes'. 'Staged Changes' are not tracked by git either.
after 'Staged Changes' it is commit. 'commit' is tracked .

that is not being added to staged changes yet.
